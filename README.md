# dev-theme-for-firefox
A Firefox Extension to compliment Kdr3w's "[Dev](https://www.deviantart.com/kdr3w/art/Dev-825722799)" Windows Theme

[Chrome Version](https://github.com/Optinux/dev-theme-for-chrome)

# Installation
1.) Download the files and then head over to your firefox based browser

2.) Put "about:addons" in the address bar and hit enter

3.) Navigate to Themes > Settings (cogwheel in the top right corner) > Install addon from file...

4.) Now just select the .xpi and load the theme

# Optional
Ive created a custom DuckDuckGo-Theme to go with this extension!

Just load the following passphrase in the settings: `DEV-THEME-FOR-CHROME` (I know it says Chrome, but it still works!)
